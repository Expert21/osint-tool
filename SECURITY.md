# Hermes OSINT Security Policy

## 1. Purpose

This document outlines the security practices, responsible disclosure process, and safe usage guidelines for Hermes OSINT. Our goal is to ensure that the project is used ethically and securely, and that vulnerabilities are handled responsibly.

Hermes OSINT is intended for **ethical OSINT research only**. Users must comply with all applicable laws and regulations when using the software.

## 2. Reporting Security Vulnerabilities

If you discover a security vulnerability in Hermes OSINT, please report it responsibly to ensure it can be addressed promptly:

- **Email:** isaiahmyles04@protonmail.com
- **Response Time:** We aim to acknowledge all reports within 72 hours and provide updates on resolution as appropriate.

**Please do not** publicly disclose vulnerabilities before they have been addressed, as this could put users at risk.

## 3. Safe Usage Guidelines

Hermes OSINT orchestrates multiple OSINT tools and interacts with external services. Users should:

- Only run Hermes OSINT in environments where they have permission to collect data.
- Understand that using the tool against unauthorized systems may violate laws and regulations.
- Take appropriate precautions to protect personal and sensitive data during research.

**Disclaimer:** Users are solely responsible for their own use of Hermes OSINT.

## 4. Data Handling & Privacy

- Hermes OSINT uses **ephemeral Docker containers** for executing tools, which are deleted after execution to minimize persistent data.
- Any logs, outputs, or temporary files generated by modules should be handled responsibly by the user, especially if they contain sensitive information.
- The project does not collect or transmit data to any external services. All data processed by Hermes OSINT remains on the user's local machine.

## 5. Security Practices for Contributors

- Hermes OSINT contributors should follow secure coding practices, including input validation, sanitization, and careful handling of external dependencies.
- Pull requests should be reviewed for potential security issues, especially when adding new modules or plugins.
- Keep dependencies up-to-date and review Docker images for security updates.
