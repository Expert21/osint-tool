## [1.6.0] - 2025-11-28

### Added 
- Parallel Execution System: Tiered async execution framework for concurrent tool operations
- Resource Auto-Detection: Automatic detection of system resources (CPU cores, memory) for optimal worker allocation
- Configurable Concurrency: `--workers` flag to manually set parallel worker count
- Cross-Tool Correlation: Intelligent result aggregation across multiple OSINT tools with relationship mapping
- Duplicate Detection: Advanced deduplication engine with smart matching algorithms
- Enhanced Confidence Scoring: Multi-source confidence calculation with weighted attribution
- 5 New Tool Adapters:
  - Holehe - Email account enumeration across 120+ platforms
  - PhoneInfoga - Advanced phone number OSINT and footprinting
  - Sublist3r - Fast subdomain enumeration via search engines
  - Photon - Intelligent web crawler for OSINT
  - Exiftool - Metadata extraction from images and documents
- Source Attribution: Track and display which tools discovered each piece of intelligence
- Enhanced Reporting: All report formats now include source metadata and confidence metrics

### Changed
- Report templates updated with source attribution tables and confidence visualizations
- Statistics engine now calculates cross-tool correlation metrics
- Caching system optimized for parallel execution scenarios

- Passive intelligence module (HIBP, PGP keyservers, search dorking)
- Scan logger with structured JSON/CSV output
- `--passive` flag for stealth mode operations
- Confidence scoring system (0.0-1.0)
- Source metadata tags (HIBP, PGP, Dork, Active)

### Changed
- Email enumeration refactored to passive-first approach
- Social media checks now use two-tier verification
- Enhanced error handling with graceful degradation
- Improved reporting with confidence badges

## [1.2.2] - 2025-11-21

### Security
- Input validation for all CLI arguments
- Log sanitization to redact sensitive data
