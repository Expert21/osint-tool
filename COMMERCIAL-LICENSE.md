# Hermes OSINT Tool - Commercial License

## Enterprise Edition

2. **Enterprise Edition** - Proprietary Commercial License (this document)

---

## 🏢 Why Choose a Commercial License?

The AGPL-3.0 license requires that if you modify Hermes and provide it as a network service (SaaS, internal platform, API, etc.), you **must** release your source code publicly.

A **Commercial License** grants you the freedom to:

### ✅ What You Get

- **Proprietary Modifications** - Keep your customizations and integrations private
- **SaaS Deployment** - Run Hermes as a service without source code disclosure
- **No Copyleft Obligations** - Use Hermes in closed-source products
- **Enterprise Features** - Access to advanced capabilities not in the Community Edition
- **Priority Support** - Dedicated technical support with SLA guarantees
- **Legal Protection** - Indemnification and compliance assistance
- **Perpetual Updates** - Receive all updates and security patches
- **White-Label Options** - Rebrand and integrate without attribution requirements

---

## 🎯 Who Needs a Commercial License?

You likely need a commercial license if:

- ❗ You're running Hermes as part of a SaaS product
- ❗ You're embedding Hermes in proprietary software
- ❗ You're offering OSINT services using a modified version
- ❗ Your legal/compliance team has concerns about AGPL-3.0
- ❗ You can't or don't want to disclose your source code
- ❗ You need guaranteed support and uptime SLAs
